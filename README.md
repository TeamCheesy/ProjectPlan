# Summer-of-Code-Planning-

Summer of Code starts July 1st, ends Sept 30th. 

Project Plan from our application:

Milestone 1 "Start-up phase" (week 1-3):
* Preparation: 
- Get the teams app running locally
- Familiarize with the teams app in all its aspects (applications phase, summer phase, winter phase) and for the different users (organizers, teams, supervisors) 
* Warming up:
- Get familiar with proces of committing and GitHub by doing our first commits for smaller issues, e.g.:   
#186 add upload button  https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/186
#108 weird view  https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/108
#17 team logo https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/17
#190 https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/190
#192
or similar, when those are no longer available.
- Learn & train basics of Test Driven Development

Milestone 2 "Dashboard phase" (week 3-8):
- Create supervisor dashboard #109 and/= #60?  https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/109
and add join team function (#187) https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/187
- Create teams dashboard (integrate and optimize the log engine function, integrate #187 join team pull request)
- After the two dashboards are created, decide if necessary to create organizer dashboard. Otherwise integrate organizer functionality.

Milestone 3 "Application optimization" (week 8-12):
- Combine inputs of personal pages and team-page (#184) https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/184
- Improve application form (#131 ?)
- Improve usability of application process (f.e. make it multi-step, add a process visualization (10%-30% etc.)
- Improve visual appearance
